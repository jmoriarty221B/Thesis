The purpose of this app is to allow the user to view an animation of the aircraft pitch control system with the step response plot. This allows the user to see the correlation between the plot and the systems physical response.

The animation and the app are based on the Aircraft Pitch: State-Space Controller Design page of controls tutorials:
